Scope

(cid:0) The focus of this mini-symposium will be the industrial testcase of

external flow over a static DrivAer automotive model, investigated as case 2 in the 
AutoCFD2 workshop, and as case 2a in the subsequent AutoCFD3 & AutoCFD4 
workshops

(cid:0) A full OpenFOAM setup* of the testcase, including meshes, physical model, and solver 

selection can be found here

(cid:0) Reference numerical results shall also be made available soon

(cid:0)

(cid:0)

In the hardware track, participants are invited to submit and present results obtained 
with the pre-defined setup using an official OpenFOAM version, on any combination 
of hardware

In the software track, participants are invited to submit and present results obtained 
with any OpenFOAM version and custom solver, on any hardware, so long as the 
mesh and physical modelling remains true to source, and accuracy is retained

(cid:0) Participants are also invited to submit and present HPC enhancements related to pre- 

and post-processing of OpenFOAM data, applied to the above testcase

*Special thanks to Upstream CFD for providing the OpenFOAM DrivAer setup,
 which has been adapted for the OHC-1
